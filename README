This is a user input script that checks the realizability of combinatorial configurations of complex projective line arrangements.

The algorithm in the script is based on the correspondence between arrangements of d lines in the projective plane and lines in P^{d-2}, introduced in the paper by G.Urzua available here:

https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0469

The input consists of a set of multiple points (of multiplicity at least 3)  and the number of ‘lines’ of the theoretical configuration. The output, if the configuration is realizable as an arrangement of lines in  the complex projective plane, consists of a set of equations whose coefficients may depend on a number of  parameters. This describes a reduced moduli space for the given combinatorial configuration as an arrangement of lines in the complex projective plane.

The multiple points are declared as a string, by the following convention: lines passing through a multiple point separated by spaces; multiple points separated by commas; the lines in A are labeled by L_1,...,L_|A|.

Example: The input /output for a combinatorial configuration of 8 lines with one quadruple point  (4 5 6 7) and three triple points (2 3 4), (1 3 6), (1 2 7):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INPUT:
input a set of multiple points of multiplicity at least 3 --> 4 5 6 7, 2 3 4, 1 3 6, 1 2 7
the number of hyperplanes of the arrangement is --> 8

OUTPUT: 
the set S_0 of hyperplane equations is:

 L_8 :  x + z + y*(b_78*v_1 - v_2*(b_78 + v_1 - v_2))/v_1

 L_1 :  -x/(v_1 - v_2) + y + z

 L_2 :  z + y*(v_1 - v_2)/v_1

 L_3 : z 
 
 L_4 : y 
 
 L_5 : x

 L_6 :  v_1*x/(v_1 - v_2) - v_1*y

 L_7 :  v_1*x/(v_1 - v_2) – v_2*y

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The parameters in the coefficients of the line equations are of type a_**, b_**, v_*, t_*.  A finite number of values for the parameters are excluded.
